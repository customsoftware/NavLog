Welcome to NavLog. It is a tool for pilots to fly safely. It does two main things:
1.  It helps compute take off and landing performance using the aircraft's performance capabilities and current weather and current aircraft load.
2.  It helps track your flight using the iPhone's built in GPS receiver. In this capacity, it acts as a simple HSI giving you stearing information, heading, airspeed and altitude.

The app computes take-off and landing performance by obtaining the current METAR from either the nearest airport (if no airport is entered) or for the designated airport when you enter the airports FAA symbol. It will automatically select the best runway to use. It also uses weight and balance data to compute the performance values. Lastly, it also uses climb, cruise, take off length and landing distance length data to compute take off roll and landing roll. 

The app has the ability to import both Dynon and Garmin formatted flight plans. You can use a free website like SkyVector to build your flight plan, then export the plan and email it to yourself. Once you have the email, save the flight plane to your iPhone and import it from the app. Once there, you can update the planned airspeeds (those don't get exported). Then when you take off, tap the start button. It will then give you heading and distance to the next waypoint in your flight plan.

This version of the app allows you to enter the aircraft's essential weight and balance data points. It then presents a simple way to enter mission specific weight and balance data. With this data is gives you a quick answer as to whether you are not only within weight limits but if you are also within balance limits.

This version does NOT as yet give you the ability to enter take off roll, climb and cruise data. It is currently hard coded for a Cessna Cardinal (C177). Subsequent versions will allow you to either enter these performance metrics automatically, or buy a pre-built performance configuration package.
